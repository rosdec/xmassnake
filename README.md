# xmassnake
C64 Game written in BASIC v2. For the development you may want to use [C64 .prg Studio](https://www.ajordison.co.uk/), in that case you will find an handy project file. 

The game is pretty simple, it is a snake-like game, you have to run across the xmas tree to reach the star on top, avoiding falling down.
